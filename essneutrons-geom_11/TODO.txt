STATE OF THE ART

Print position in Pre and Post step of neutrons escaping from the target,
through Pre and Post Step points.

TODO

1. Implementation of a cylinder, external to the target and the moderator,
  in order to characterize the surface neutron source
2. Postprocessing with Python for flux distribution and visualization
3. Postprocessing for:
    flux surface mesh (suggestion: mesh for each part of the wheel)
    energy spectrum and angular discretization tables, associated to each
    surface mesh cell

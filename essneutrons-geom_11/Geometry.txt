GEOMETRY STATE OF THE ART

A brief description of how the geometry is defined. This geometry is based on the WWG.i MCNP file.

* The moderator, in order to characterize the surface neutron source, not include -  Original file had No coincidence with MCNP.
* The reflector has been simplified compared to the first version.

GEOMETRY FILES.

- LOWER LEVEL OF THE INSTALLATION - Water (from MCNP).
  - One possible locations is the Hall. This is described here.

- GROUND LEVEL OF THE INSTALLATION - Concrete.

- BUNKER (Bunk) MAGNADENSE8 BY LKAB MINERALS (bunker density).
  - The bunker has a long and a short sector in both sides. Four different files are used to describe this.

  A. ESSN_BunkerL.cc - Long Left Sector.
  B. ESSN_BunkerS.cc - Short Left Sector.
  C. ESSN_BunkerLR.cc - Long Right Sector.
  D. ESSN_BunkerSR.cc - Short Right Sector.

- CONCRETE SHIELD - Concrete Shielding.

  1. Cylindrical surrounding the target (ConcreteShield).

  2. Concrete Roof, Floor and Walls (CShCap, CShLWall, CShSWall).
    And air gaps in between.


- OUTER TARGET SHIELDING (OTrSh) - Carbon Steel Shielding.

  A. ESSN_OutTrShield.cc
    - Separated file of Carbon Steel shielding layer -

    1. Carbon Steel cylinder with a 63deg aperture SS316L shield.

    2. The corresponding Proton beam in this mother volumen.
    3. Beryllium window added


- SS136L Dome on top of Target Shielding with an inner vacuum Dome.

- INNER TARGET SS316L SHIELDING (TrSh)

    A. ESSN_SSTrShield.cc
      - This part of the geometry englobes all the elements inside the stainless steel (SS316L) cylinder shielding around the target -

      1. Implementation of the tungsten target and the SS316L and vacuum around it.
        The vacuum structure still needs some more details compared to the MCNP file.

      2. Beryllium reflector surrounded by vacuum (simplified design).

      3. The part of Proton beam inside this region.

      4. Vacuum tubes at the SS shielding edge.

    B. ESSN_UpperSSTrShield.cc
      - Upper part of the previous geometry. To avoid overlaps some of the volumes
      are split into parts and defined in both ESSN_SSTrShield and ESSN_UpperSSTrShield files -

      1. Beryllium tube above target.

      2. Vacuum tubes at the SS shielding edge.

    C. ESSN_ConcTrShield.cc
      - Concrete regular + 50%Fe block below SS316L shielding -

-  ROOMS AT 3 LEVELS both LEFT and RIGHT sides.

  A. Ground Level
    * ESSN_GroundRoomL.cc - Implementation of Left side ground level rooms

    * ESSN_GroundRoomR.cc - Implementation of Left side ground level rooms
      1. Triangle room
      2. The corresponding Proton beam in this mother volumen.

  B. Top Level rooms
  C. Lower level rooms
